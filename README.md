# OldPortfolio
This is no longer my current portfolio, but I wanted to leave it here to show how my designs and functionality has improved as I practice more. My current portfolio can be found at www.CameronHackwith.com, and my source code can be found [here](https://github.com/hackwithcameron/PortfolioDjango)
